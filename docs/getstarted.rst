Getting Started
===============

You may be here because you want to get the
Diddi Platforms game or set up customization.
If so, you're in the right place.

Acquire the game - just to play
-------------------------------

If you're just looking for a nice gaming experience,
with no customization, both the Windows dist and the
Pyxel app.

Acquire the game - to set up customization
------------------------------------------

So you want to write or play custom maps, the
pure Python edition would fit better with your
needs. It's even better if you install Python and
the core package of the game.

To get the package (``diddi_platforms``), you use
tools such as Pip:

::

    python -m pip install diddi_platforms
