The Diddi Platforms universe
============================

This is a quick guide about this game's canonical
universe, as described in the default game/configs.

Background
----------

This game is the 3rth piece in Diddi Games
Collection, a bunch of `games by @DiddiLeija`_.
This collection shares the same universe/story.

`Diddi`_ is a crime fighter that uses tech rather than
strength. He has already featured a few `games by
@DiddiLeija`_, where you'll learn a bit about this
character. In a few words:

* Diddi's starfighter, the Willpower, has taken on a bugs invasion on Earth (`Diddi and the Bugs`).
* Diddi also had to escape from a doomed spaceship (`Abandon the Ship!`)

The goal of the canonical levels
--------------------------------

Diddi has been tasked by Lady Alix, an influential
woman and a close friend, to beat a bunch of pirates
across several parts in the galaxy. Also, Diddi must
try to take on the boss behind the ravaging.

The expanded universe
---------------------

Diddi Platforms is an extensible game, indeed! You
can both make and play your own levels, extending
the universe as you wish!
